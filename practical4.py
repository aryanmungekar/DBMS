# Run the n_queens function to start
n_queens()

#The n_queens function begins by prompting the user to input the number of queens (n). 
#The input is stored as an integer, which will be the number of queens and also 
#the dimension of the chessboard (an n x n board).
#We initialize a board represented by a 2D list of zeros. Each element in this n x n list is set to 0, meaning no queen is placed there initially.
#Each row represents a row on the chessboard, and each element in a row (column) can either be 0 (empty) or 1 (contains a queen).
#The solve_n_queens function is designed to try placing queens column by column, from the first column (leftmost) to the last (rightmost).
#To ensure no two queens threaten each other, is_safe checks three conditions:
#Row Check: It verifies that no queens are already placed in the same row on the left side.
#Upper Left Diagonal Check: It ensures that no queens are on the upper left diagonal.
#Lower Left Diagonal Check: It checks the lower left diagonal for any existing queens.
#If a queen is placed such that none of these conditions are violated, itâ€™s considered a safe position.
#If a safe position is found, the queen is placed there (the cell is set to 1).
#The function then recursively attempts to place queens in the next column.
